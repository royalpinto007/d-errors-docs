Errors in D can be classified into the following categories:

### Syntax Errors
- Occur when the compiler encounters invalid code syntax.
- Example: Missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, etc.

### Runtime Errors
- Occur during program execution, such as out-of-memory errors or division by zero.

### Deprecation Warnings
- Indicate features that are no longer supported and may be removed in future versions.

### Compilation Errors
- Happen when the compiler cannot generate valid machine code for the program.
