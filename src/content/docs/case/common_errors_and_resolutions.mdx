priority: 1
---

This section covers frequently encountered errors in D, their causes, and step-by-step solutions. Each example includes an explanation of the error and a code snippet illustrating how to fix it.

---

## 1. Undefined Identifier

### Error Message:
```
Error: undefined identifier `x`
```

### Cause:
This error occurs when you reference a variable or function that hasn’t been declared in the current scope.

### Example Code:
```d
void main() {
    x = 10; // Undefined variable
}
```

### Resolution:
Declare the variable `x` before using it:
```d
void main() {
    int x = 10;
    writeln(x);
}
```

---

## 2. Missing Semicolon

### Error Message:
```
Error: ';' expected following statement
```

### Cause:
A semicolon is missing at the end of a statement.

### Example Code:
```d
void main() {
    writeln("Hello, World!") // Missing semicolon
}
```

### Resolution:
Add a semicolon to terminate the statement:
```d
void main() {
    writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

---

## 3. Type Mismatch

### Error Message:
```
Error: cannot implicitly convert expression `5.5` of type `double` to `int`
```

### Cause:
The type of an expression doesn’t match the expected type.

### Example Code:
```d
void main() {
    int x = 5.5; // Type mismatch
}
```

### Resolution:
Use explicit type casting to convert `double` to `int`:
```d
void main() {
    int x = cast(int) 5.5;
    writeln(x);
}
```

---

## 4. Deprecated Function Usage

### Warning Message:
```
Warning: function `foo` is deprecated
```

### Cause:
You are using a function or feature that has been marked as deprecated and may be removed in future versions.

### Example Code:
```d
void foo() deprecated("Use `bar` instead") {}

void main() {
    foo();
}
```

### Resolution:
Replace the deprecated function with its recommended alternative:
```d
void bar() {}

void main() {
    bar();
}
```

---

## 5. Module Not Found

### Error Message:
```
Error: module `std.unknown` is not found
```

### Cause:
You are importing a module that doesn’t exist or isn’t included in your project.

### Example Code:
```d
import std.unknown;

void main() {
    writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Resolution:
Ensure the module exists and the import statement is correct:
```d
import std.stdio;

void main() {
    writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

---

## 6. Division by Zero in Compile-Time Constants

### Error Message:
```
Error: division by zero is not allowed in constant expressions
```

### Cause:
You attempted to divide by zero in a `constexpr` or constant expression.

### Example Code:
```d
enum x = 10 / 0; // Division by zero
```

### Resolution:
Ensure the divisor is non-zero:
```d
enum x = 10 / 2;
```

---

## 7. Circular Import Dependency

### Error Message:
```
Error: module `a` recursively imports itself
```

### Cause:
Two or more modules depend on each other in a circular manner.

### Example Code:
```d
// a.d
import b;

// b.d
import a;
```

### Resolution:
Refactor the code to remove circular dependencies:
```d
// a.d
import c;

// b.d
import c;

// c.d
// Shared functionality
```

---

## 8. Unreachable Code

### Warning Message:
```
Warning: statement is not reachable
```

### Cause:
Code appears after a `return`, `break`, or other control flow statements that prevent execution.

### Example Code:
```d
void main() {
    return;
    writeln("This will never execute"); // Unreachable code
}
```

### Resolution:
Remove or restructure the unreachable code:
```d
void main() {
    writeln("This will execute");
}
```

## Best Practices for Resolving Errors

1. **Read the Error Message Carefully**: Understand the issue before attempting to fix it.
2. **Use Compiler Flags**: Enable detailed error messages with flags like `-v` or `-verrors=2`.
3. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the official D documentation or community resources for additional help.
4. **Break Down the Problem**: Isolate the code causing the error to debug it effectively.
5. **Write Unit Tests**: Test edge cases to catch errors early in development.
