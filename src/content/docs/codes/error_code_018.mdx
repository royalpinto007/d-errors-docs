## **Overview**
A segmentation fault occurs when a program tries to access memory it is not allowed to. This is often caused by dereferencing invalid pointers, accessing memory out of bounds, or writing to read-only memory.

---

## **Details**
- **Common Causes**:
  - Dereferencing null or uninitialized pointers.
  - Accessing memory beyond allocated bounds.
  - Writing to memory marked as read-only.

- **Example**:
```d
void main() {
    int* ptr = null;
    *ptr = 42; // Error: segmentation fault
}
```

- **Solution**:
  - Ensure pointers are initialized before use:
    ```d
    void main() {
        int x = 42;
        int* ptr = &x;
        *ptr = 43; // Safe
    }
    ```
  - Use bounds checking for arrays to prevent accessing out-of-bound elements:
    ```d
    void main() {
        int[] arr = [1, 2, 3];
        if (arr.length > 2) {
            writeln(arr[2]); // Safe
        }
    }
    ```
  - Use modern memory-safe constructs like `@safe` or `@trusted` to reduce the likelihood of segmentation faults.
