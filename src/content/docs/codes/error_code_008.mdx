## **Overview**
This error occurs when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. In most cases, this results in a runtime error or an exception, as division by zero is undefined.

---

## **Details**
- **Common Causes**:
  - Dividing by a variable that has a value of zero.
  - Using hardcoded zero as a divisor in calculations.

- **Example**:
```d
void main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int result = x / y; // Error: division by zero
}
```

- **Solution**:
  - Ensure the divisor is non-zero before performing the division:
    ```d
    void main() {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 2;
        if (y != 0) {
            int result = x / y;
            writeln(result); // Safe
        }
    }
    ```
  - Handle potential zero division with error handling:
    ```d
    void safeDivide(int x, int y) {
        try {
            if (y == 0) {
                throw new Exception("Cannot divide by zero.");
            }
            writeln(x / y);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            writeln(e.msg);
        }
    }
    ```
