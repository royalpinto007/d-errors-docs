description: Explanation for Memory Leak Detected
priority: 12
---

## **Overview**
This error indicates that memory allocated during program execution was not properly released, leading to resource exhaustion over time. Memory leaks are common in programs that manage memory manually.

---

## **Details**
- **Common Causes**:
  - Forgetting to free memory allocated with `malloc` or similar functions.
  - Circular references in garbage-collected environments.
  - Holding references to objects that are no longer needed.

- **Example**:
```d
import core.stdc.stdlib;

void main() {
    int* ptr = cast(int*) malloc(int.sizeof);
    *ptr = 42;
    // Memory leak: no call to free(ptr)
}
```

- **Solution**:
  - Free allocated memory when it is no longer needed:
    ```d
    import core.stdc.stdlib;

    void main() {
        int* ptr = cast(int*) malloc(int.sizeof);
        *ptr = 42;
        free(ptr); // Proper memory management
    }
    ```
  - Use scope-bound resource management or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):
    ```d
    struct Resource {
        this() { writeln("Acquired resource"); }
        ~this() { writeln("Released resource"); }
    }

    void main() {
        {
            auto r = Resource();
        } // Automatically releases the resource
    }
    ```
