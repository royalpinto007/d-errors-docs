description: Explanation for Deprecated Feature Used
priority: 19
---

## **Overview**
This error occurs when a program uses a feature or functionality that has been marked as deprecated. While deprecated features are still functional, they are scheduled for removal in future versions and should be avoided.

---

## **Details**
- **Common Causes**:
  - Using library functions or language features marked as deprecated.
  - Failing to update code after deprecation warnings in previous versions.

- **Example**:
```d
void oldFunction() {
    deprecated("Use newFunction instead") void deprecatedFunction() {
        writeln("Deprecated function called.");
    }

    deprecatedFunction(); // Error: deprecated feature used
}
```

- **Solution**:
  - Replace deprecated features with their recommended alternatives:
    ```d
    void newFunction() {
        writeln("This is the new function.");
    }

    void main() {
        newFunction(); // Use the updated feature
    }
    ```
  - Check release notes and documentation for deprecated features and their replacements.
  - Use compiler warnings to identify deprecated features early.
