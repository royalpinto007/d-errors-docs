description: Explanation for Invalid Cast
priority: 15
---

## **Overview**
This error occurs when attempting to perform a type cast that is either unsupported or unsafe. It can happen when trying to cast incompatible types or when the cast results in undefined behavior.

---

## **Details**
- **Common Causes**:
  - Casting between unrelated or incompatible types.
  - Casting a base class to a derived class without proper inheritance.
  - Unsafe pointer casts that lead to runtime errors.

- **Example**:
```d
void main() {
    void* ptr = null;
    int* intPtr = cast(int*) ptr; // Error: invalid cast
}
```

- **Solution**:
  - Ensure the cast is valid by verifying type compatibility:
    ```d
    void main() {
        void* ptr = cast(void*) malloc(int.sizeof);
        int* intPtr = cast(int*) ptr; // Valid cast
        free(ptr);
    }
    ```
  - Use dynamic casts for safe runtime type checking:
    ```d
    class Base {}
    class Derived : Base {}

    void main() {
        Base obj = new Base();
        auto derivedObj = cast(Derived) obj; // Returns null if invalid
    }
    ```
  - Avoid unnecessary or unsafe casts by designing code with proper type constraints.
