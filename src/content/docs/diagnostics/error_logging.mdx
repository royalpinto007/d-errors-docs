Error logging is essential for diagnosing, debugging, and maintaining software. In the D programming language, efficient logging helps developers track down issues and ensure smoother error recovery.

---

## Why is Error Logging Important?

1. **Traceability**: Logs provide a history of errors and events for debugging.
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Identify recurring issues before they escalate.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Share logs for better team coordination.
4. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory or operational requirements with proper logging.

## Logging Methods in D

### 1. **Using `std.experimental.logger`**
The `std.experimental.logger` module is a built-in library for structured logging in D.

#### Basic Usage:
```d
import std.experimental.logger;

void main() {
    logInfo("Application started");
    logError("An error occurred");
}
```

#### Log Levels:
- **`logTrace`**: Fine-grained informational events.
- **`logDebug`**: Debugging information.
- **`logInfo`**: General application events.
- **`logWarn`**: Potentially harmful situations.
- **`logError`**: Error events that might still allow the application to run.
- **`logFatal`**: Severe errors causing premature termination.

### 2. **Using `writeln` for Simple Logs**
For small-scale projects, `writeln` is a quick way to log errors:
```d
import std.stdio;

void main() {
    writeln("[ERROR] File not found: config.json");
}
```

---

### 3. **Custom Logging Solutions**
You can create custom logging mechanisms for more control:
```d
import std.file;
import std.datetime;

void logMessage(string level, string message) {
    auto timestamp = Clock.currTime.toISOExtString();
    string logEntry = format("[%s] %s: %s\n", timestamp, level, message);
    append("app.log", logEntry);
}

void main() {
    logMessage("ERROR", "Failed to connect to database");
}
```

---

## Where to Log Errors

### 1. **Console**
Best for development and debugging environments. Logs are immediately visible:
```d
logError("This is a console log.");
```

### 2. **Log Files**
Ideal for production environments where persistent logs are required:
```d
logMessage("INFO", "Server started at port 8080.");
```

### 3. **External Systems**
Integrate logs with monitoring systems like Prometheus, Splunk, or ELK Stack for advanced analytics:
```d
logInfo("Error data sent to monitoring service.");
```

## Best Practices for Logging

### 1. **Log Only What’s Necessary**
Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

### 2. **Use Structured Logs**
Structured logs are easier to parse and analyze:
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-01-14T12:34:56Z",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "message": "Connection timed out",
    "context": {
        "host": "example.com",
        "port": 443
    }
}
```

### 3. **Include Context**
Add details like file names, line numbers, and function names:
```d
logError("File upload failed", "file: upload.d, line: 42");
```

### 4. **Rotate Log Files**
Prevent log files from growing indefinitely by rotating them:
- Use tools like **logrotate** on Linux.
- Write custom file rotation logic in D:
  ```d
  import std.file;

  void rotateLogs(string fileName) {
      if (fileSize(fileName) > 10_000) { // Rotate if file size exceeds 10KB
          rename(fileName, fileName ~ ".old");
      }
  }
  ```

## Debugging with Logs

1. **Correlate Logs**: Use timestamps to identify related events.
2. **Search and Filter**: Use tools like `grep` to extract relevant logs:
   ```bash
   grep "ERROR" app.log
   ```
3. **Visualize Logs**: Use dashboards or visualization tools for better insights.

---

## Example: Advanced Logging with Context

Here’s a complete example of logging with context and error levels:
```d
import std.experimental.logger;
import std.format;

void main() {
    logInfo("Application started");

    try {
        int x = 10 / 0; // Runtime error
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logError(format("Exception caught: %s", e.msg));
    }

    logWarn("Memory usage is high");
    logFatal("Application shutting down unexpectedly");
}
```

---

## Example: Writing Logs to a File

Write all logs to a file for persistent storage:
```d
import std.file;

void logToFile(string level, string message) {
    string logEntry = format("[%s] %s\n", level, message);
    append("application.log", logEntry);
}

void main() {
    logToFile("INFO", "Server started.");
    logToFile("ERROR", "Failed to connect to database.");
}
```

**Output in `application.log`:**
```
[INFO] Server started.
[ERROR] Failed to connect to database.
```

## Key Takeaways

- Effective logging improves debugging, monitoring, and collaboration.
- Use `std.experimental.logger` for structured logging in D.
- Log messages with meaningful levels and context.
- Store logs in appropriate locations (console, files, or external systems) based on the environment.
- Follow best practices to ensure logs are helpful and secure.
