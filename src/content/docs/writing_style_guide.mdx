---

This guide provides best practices and conventions for writing high-quality documentation for **D Error Insights**. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and a professional tone across the project.

---

## General Writing Guidelines

### 1. Be Concise
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex language.
- Example:
  - **Good**: "Declare variables before using them."
  - **Bad**: "Prior to utilization, variables must undergo declaration."

### 2. Maintain a Neutral Tone
- Avoid overly casual or technical slang.
- Example:
  - **Good**: "This function is deprecated. Use `newFunction` instead."
  - **Bad**: "Don't use this outdated function, it’s obsolete!"

### 3. Focus on the Reader
- Assume the reader is a D developer looking for solutions.
- Write explanations and examples that are actionable and easy to follow.

---

## Formatting Guidelines

### 1. Headings
- Use headings to organize content into logical sections.
- Stick to sentence case for all headings.
- Example:
  ```md
  # Error Handling Basics
  ## Causes of Syntax Errors
  ### Resolving Common Issues
  ```

### 2. Code Blocks
- Always include code examples for clarity.
- Use triple backticks for code blocks and specify the language:
  ```d
  void main() {
      writeln("Hello, World!");
  }
  ```

- Use inline code for single commands or function names:
  - Example: Use `error()` to log error messages.

### 3. Lists
- Use ordered lists for step-by-step instructions:
  ```md
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Create a new branch.
  3. Submit a pull request.
  ```

- Use unordered lists for general information:
  ```md
  - Errors
  - Warnings
  - Deprecations
  ```

---

## Code Examples

### 1. Relevance
- Include only relevant code snippets.
- Avoid overly long examples; focus on the part that illustrates the concept.

### 2. Consistency
- Use consistent formatting and indentation.
- Always include a short explanation before the code block.

### Example:
```d
// Example: Handling undefined identifiers
void main() {
    int x = 5; // Declare the variable
    writeln(x);
}
```

---

## Language and Terminology

### 1. Use Standard Terminology
- Use terms consistent with the D language documentation.
- Avoid inventing new terms unless absolutely necessary.

### 2. Avoid Ambiguity
- Be precise when referring to concepts like "errors," "warnings," or "deprecations."
- Example:
  - **Good**: "Warnings highlight non-critical issues."
  - **Bad**: "Warnings are not that important."

### 3. Use Inclusive Language
- Avoid terms that may exclude or alienate readers.
- Example:
  - **Good**: "Ensure the code runs as expected."
  - **Bad**: "Make sure your code isn’t stupid."

---

## Style Conventions

### 1. Spelling and Grammar
- Follow American English spelling conventions (e.g., "color," not "colour").
- Proofread for grammatical accuracy.

### 2. Capitalization
- Use proper capitalization for function names, file names, and technical terms.
- Example:
  - `error()`, `warningSupplemental`, `DiagnosticHandler`

### 3. Punctuation
- Use proper punctuation for clarity and readability.
- Example:
  - **Good**: "Add a semicolon to terminate the statement."
  - **Bad**: "Add a semicolon to terminate the statement"

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overloading with Details**
   - Avoid including too much unrelated information in a single section.
   - Split content into smaller, digestible parts.

2. **Inconsistent Terminology**
   - Always refer to errors, warnings, and other terms consistently throughout.

3. **Missing Explanations**
   - Always explain code snippets and examples. Don’t assume the reader knows the context.

---

## Examples of Well-Written Documentation

### Good Example:
```md
### Error Handling Basics
Use the `error()` function to log critical issues. This function increments the global error count and halts compilation.

void main() {
    error("example.d", 10, 5, "Undefined variable `x`.");
}
```

The above code logs an error and specifies the location of the issue in the source file.

### Bad Example:
```md
### Error Handling Basics
This function is used for errors.

void main() {
    error("Something went wrong!");
}
```

## Review Process

All contributions must:
1. Follow this writing style guide.
2. Be peer-reviewed before merging into the repository.
3. Include appropriate labels for pull requests, such as `docs` or `enhancement`.

## Key Takeaways

- Keep documentation clear, concise, and actionable.
- Maintain consistent formatting, terminology, and tone.
- Always include relevant code examples with explanations.
